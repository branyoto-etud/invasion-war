# Invasion-War

C project done in L3

# Wat is dis ?

This is a student project done in collaboration with [osef](https://github.com/osef-art) who did all illustrations and UIs.
If his style fit you, check his website [here](https://osef-art.github.io/).

The subject was to create a space shooter (like Space Invader) with some requirements.

If you're intrested in this project, (which is really unlikely) you need to install [this library](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~boussica/mlv/api/French/html/index.html).

Then run the file `lancement.sh` (it means 'start' in French) and pray Staan.  
If praying Staan doesn't help the situation, feel free to open an issue or 
to send me mail at `bgc77160@gmail.com`.

# Important

This project is not maintained nor updated and has even no guarantee to work.  
It was made at the end of the first semester of my third year of License and 
was working at this moment on the uni computers.
